## About this Book
The Arm Digital Signal Processing (DSP) textbook introduces readers to DSP fundamentals using low-cost, high-performance Arm Cortex-M based microcontrollers as demonstrator platforms. To help readers understand DSP, it covers foundational concepts, principles and techniques, such as signals and systems, sampling, reconstruction and anti-aliasing, FIR and IIR filter design, transforms, and adaptive signal processing. Key features for those learning DSP include a set of hands-on labs that highlight the practical side, end-of-chapter exercises that reinforce the theoretical concepts presented (with answers available online), and online instructor resources. 

The textbook is suitable for use in Electronic and Computer Engineering (ECE), Electrical Engineering (EE) and Computer Science (CS) university departments. The labs in this textbook edition target the low-cost Arm Cortex M4-based STM32F4 Discovery microcontroller board. Answers to the lab exercises can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/arm-university/Digital-Signal-Processing-using-Arm-Cortex-M-based-Microcontrollers/blob/main/Exercise%20Answers%20to%20Labs_DSPtextbook.7z).

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.

Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This book may contain references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community.
